NHL_data
========
This repo is a Python/Scrapy project that is attempting to scrape all individual season data from NHL.com and prepare it to be copied into a SQL database.

## Requirements

* Scrapy is a Python 2.7+ framework that has several dependancies.  For a full install procedure, see http://doc.scrapy.org/en/latest/intro/install.html.

* Additional Python libraries in use are csv and simplejson (though the use of the json format may be on the way out in future versions).
